## Running

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

For a more advanced demonstration, head to [`localhost:4000/groceries`](http://localhost:4000/groceries).
This shows how to interact with a database, forms, and navigation.
